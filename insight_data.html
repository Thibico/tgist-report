										Civil servants are hesitant to share data that reflect challenges on the ground.
									</p>
									<p>
										Incomplete or low-quality data may result from challenges on the ground such as inadequate staffing, low data literacy, or lack of technical support. This causes major delays in publishing data; in some cases, data is even fabricated to “look nice,” which can become a source of embarrassment for the department when data is verified. Moving forward, a key design question remains: how might we create space for the government to work with and be honest about incomplete data?
									</p>
									<div class="explainer style5">
										The colloquial term စာရင်းမငြိမ် (sa-yinn-ma-nyein) referring to incomplete or unfinalized data literally means “moving records.”

										<h4>[Case Study] Housing the Township GIS Tool</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Finding a home for the Township GIS Tool (TGIST) is an ongoing process beset by many uncertainties. While township offices would be responsible for making sure data is up-to-date, accurate, and shared to the right people, we still needed to find a place to securely house the physical servers – central repositories that store and ‘serve’ data to township offices over the internet.</li>
											<li>The current arrangement is for TGIST to be handed over to respective state and regional governments. This runs counter to most e-government initiatives in Myanmar, which are almost exclusively housed in and managed by the Union-level bodies. We have, in addition, found that technical management capacity and infrastructure at the state and regional level might be insufficient for the needs of a tool like TGIST, though individual states and regions may differ.</li>
											<li>A national data center being developed by the Ministry of Transport and Communication could well be the answer to our problem of housing TGIST. The Korea EXIM Bank-funded data center is to integrate all e-government technologies in line with the Myanmar e-Governance Master Plan (2016-2020).</li>
											<li>A local, decentralized tool like TGIST is an alternative approach to e-government in Myanmar. Even though Union-level management makes pragmatic sense, top-down implementation could very well reinforce existing structures instead of forging novel pathways like we originally intended.</li>

										<h4>[Case Study] How ready are departments to adopt a data-driven tech solution?</h4>
										<p>
											To better understand departments’ readiness for data-driven change, Thibi conducted a preliminary assessment across 7 departments using the Data and Tech Readiness Scorecard framework developed by the Center for Data Science and Public Policy. This assessment enabled comparisons of departments’ tech readiness based on a standardized ordinal scale and the development of hypotheses connecting scores with on-the-ground factors.
										</p>
										<p>
											Readiness was measured along 10 criteria ranging from accessibility and storage to granularity and documentation. For each readiness criterion, a department is assigned 
											a score from 1 to 4:
											<ul>
												<li>1 for “Lagging”</li>
												<li>2 for “Basic”</li>
												<li>3 for “Advanced,” and</li>
												<li>4 for “Leading.”</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
									</div>
									<div class="explainer style5">
										<h4>What is the Data and Tech Readiness Scorecard?</h4>
										<p>
											The Data and Tech Readiness Scorecard is the core of our scoring process. The scorecard is part of the Data Maturity Framework developed by Dr. Rayid Ghani (Carnegie Mellon University) for an organization’s readiness for data-driven change. <sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>

										Departments update and maintain highly detailed datasets that are often underutilized due to inaccessibility and poor documentation.
									</p>
									<p>
										Government departments have a strong culture of frequent, granular data collection as required by regulation and orders from higher-level offices. However, these datasets often sit in their source systems and are not utilized for operations, planning, and management at the local level. Even when departments use data, it is usually in the form of summary statistics in quarterly or annual reports. In this way, departments lose out on the rich insights that might result from in-depth, localized spatial analysis of existing data.

									</p>
									<p class="insight style5">
										Departments share data on a regular basis, through formal time-consuming channels or unregulated informal ones.
									</p>
									<p>
										The day-to-day workflows of some departments rely on timely data from other departments. The formal process of data sharing can be time-consuming as letters are passed between and within departments for approval. Mobile phones are used to share data informally – extending from photographed documents to images of blocked drainage pipes. Although more convenient, informally shared data can’t be used for ‘official business.’
